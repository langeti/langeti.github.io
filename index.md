Every year, new ideas arise in programming and software development to facilitate new capabilities for software systems. However, other aspects associated with software systems development are overlooked. With this in mind, the LANGETI workshop intends to serve as an open discussion platform for practitioners and researchers to share their ideas and the result of their work around the topic of automated testing for next generation and out-of-this-world applications. In particular, we encourage participation of contributions of programming languages and tools tailored for new technologies, or new application domains.

With LANGETI we want to disrupt the current state of workshops as passive presentation attending venues to more dynamic and involved work sessions. As a consequence, we will divide the workshop sessions in three moments. First, the workshop will provide a space to share high quality level research ideas around the subject of testing languages and tools for next generation platforms and systems. Second, we will have hands-on sessions for authors (or other attendants submitting a tool extended abstract) to offer a practical overview of their tool. Finally, we will have an open panel for early career or early idea presentations in a “pecha kucha” style of presentation. These presentations will try to spark conversation about researchers' ideas, to be discussed in small panels at the end of the day. The sessions will be structured as a short tutorial, where attendants to the presentation will have the opportunity to download, use, and test the tool in their own machines, following a guided example.
