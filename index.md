# Languages and Tools for Next Generation Testing Workshop - LANGETI 2020

Every year, new ideas arise in programming and software development that facilitate new capabilities for software systems. However, aspects of software systems development (testing) are overlooked. The LANGETI workshop intends to serve as an open discussion platform for practitioners and researchers to share their ideas and the results of their work around the topic of automated testing for next generation applications. 

LANGETI aims to disrupt the current state of workshops through the introduction  of more dynamic and involved working sessions. We will divide the workshop sessions into three main components. First, we will provide a space to share high quality  research ideas  focused on the subject of testing languages and tools for next generation platforms and systems. Second, we will have hands-on sessions to offer a practical overview of tools. Finally, we will have an open panel for early career researchers  and  nascent projects in a “pechakucha” style of presentation. These presentations will specifically aim to spark conversation about researchers' ideas, to be further discussed in small panels at the end of each day. 

## Intended Audience
---
The workshop looks to bring together practitioners and researchers at different stages of their career. The workshop contents should be of interest for people working on software testing in general. Moreover, with the hands-on format planned for the workshop we expect to capture the interest of both newcomers to the field and industrial practitioners alike.

## Relevance
---
Testing is a crucial part of the software development process, as it can reduce the number of bugs before deployment, and generally improve the quality of a system. From a theoretical standpoint, the topic of automated software testing  encompasses many topics of interest across the ESEC/FSE community, such as: automation, abstract interpretation, fault injection, program analysis, software verification, and software development processes. Additionally, the tools required for a successful testing process need to be developed carefully, often requiring a great deal of engineering work to get them to a stable state to be used by industry. The cross-pollination of emerging academic ideas related to automated testing, combined with presentations of “battle-hardened” industrial tools should make for an engaging and topically relevant co-located workshop.

## Format
--- 
The workshop is proposed to take place over 2 days.  The first day will commence with an initial theory-oriented keynote, followed by regular paper presentations. Each of these presentations will undergo the normal peer review process expected of research papers at academic SE venues. The second day will open with a keynote-style tutorial, followed by practical sessions showcasing a wide variety of software testing tools ranging from prototypes to mature systems. These sessions will be structured as  short tutorials, where attendants will have the opportunity to download, and use the tool in their own machines, following a guided example.  Across both days of the workshop time will be dedicated for the “pecha kucha” spotlights, wherein the  presentations on the first day  will be more theoretical in nature, and those on the second day will be more tool oriented. Note that the tool presentations taking place during the second day of the workshop do not need to be associated with a paper presented at the workshop, but can be used for the  dissemination of existing tools that are of interest to the academic and industrial software testing communities. Nonetheless, tools which are not associated with regular papers, should be accompanied  by an extended abstract to evaluate the relevance of the tool.

## Submission
---
An explicit goal of the workshop is to open a platform for new or visionary testing techniques. We are also interested in tool-oriented submissions, where participants would present and demo their testing solutions. Therefore, contributions to the workshop should ideally include, in addition to a detailed discussion of the proposed approach (for example by defining the models, mechanisms, or testing strategies underlying that approach), a discussion of how the proposed approach on software testing could influence or be influenced by other approaches and perspectives. Although it is not mandatory, we encourage the authors to include preliminary results of using the proposed approaches/tools. 
We encourage submissions that make contributions related to the topics of testing-oriented programming languages and tools tailored for new technologies, or new application domains.

We will accept contributions in the following two forms:
Technical Workshop Papers (up to 6 pages including references): Technical workshop papers should explicitly discuss new testing techniques as relevant to the workshop topics listed below. Submissions of work in early stages is encouraged, although we also suggest authors include a preliminary evaluation of their proposed techniques or discussions of the implications of findings from empirical studies.

Testing Tool Extended Abstracts (up to 2 pages including references): We encourage both academic researchers and industrial practitioners to submit extended abstracts that describe new or existing testing tools to be showcased during the workshop. Abstracts should clearly state the purpose of the tool, and provide an overview of its functionality.

The topics of interest of the workshop include, but are not limited to:

- Domain specific automated testing: mobile, web, micro-services, IoT, context-driven,  autonomous systems, etc.
- Chaos engineering
- Metamorphic testing
- Automated testing of quality attributes (performance, security, usability, etc.)
- Game/Play testing
- Mutation testing
- Model-based testing
- Artificial Intelligence for Software Testing
- Testing of artificial intelligence-based systems
- Empirical studies
- Experience/Industry reports


**Papers must be written in English, provided as PDF documents, and follow the [ESEC/FSE 2020 Format and Submission Guidelines](https://2020.esec-fse.org/attending/esec%5Esfse-2020-submission-policies), i.e., ACM Conference Format (10 point font, Times New Roman font family, numeric citation style). Submission will be managed through the the [LANGETI 2020 EasyChair conference management system](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=langeti20).**

Accepted papers will be published as part of ACM’s Digital Library. Submissions will undergo standard peer reviewing by at least three members of the program committee. Shepherding will be a possibility after notification.  All accepted papers will be allocated a presentation slot. All paper submissions are expected to present their topic together with a hands-on mini tutorial about the use/implementation of the tool/algorithm presented in their paper.

## Follow-up Plans
---
This will be the first edition of the LANGETI workshop, which we  aim to evolve into a self-sustaining workshop and a mainstay of the ESEC/FSE conference. With LANGETI we will build a community for software testing researchers and practitioners to come together. We will create an online software testing portal associated with LANGETI. The idea of the portal is to use it as a hub gathering information about authors and tools that participate in the workshop. Overtime, profiles for other researchers, and other testing tools can be added to the webpage.

In addition to this testing portal, we will record the “pecha kucha” talks, which will be added to the permanent workshop webpage. These talks will serve as a roadmap and  archive of emerging  ideas in software testing. We will add an editorial note of the workshop summarizing the main discussions (together with a detailed discussions memoir) of the workshop.

## Publicity Plans
---
The publicity strategy for the workshop will be based on an online strategy sharing the information, calls and important dates of the workshop through different local and international mailing lists. Moreover, we will focus on having a presence in social media outlets, and landing pages for the workshop’s web page linked from our institution’s website. As this will be the first edition of the workshop we expect to have 7 to 15 submissions, with an expected workshop attendance of 25+ people open to all conference participants.
