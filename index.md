# Languages and Tools for Next Generation Testing Workshop - LANGETI 2020

Every year, new ideas arise in programming and software development to facilitate new capabilities for software systems. However, other aspects associated with software systems development are overlooked. With this in mind, the LANGETI workshop intends to serve as an open discussion platform for practitioners and researchers to share their ideas and the result of their work around the topic of automated testing for next generation and out-of-this-world applications. In particular, we encourage participation of contributions of programming languages and tools tailored for new technologies, or new application domains.

With LANGETI we want to disrupt the current state of workshops as passive presentation attending venues to more dynamic and involved work sessions. As a consequence, we will divide the workshop sessions in three moments. First, the workshop will provide a space to share high quality level research ideas around the subject of testing languages and tools for next generation platforms and systems. Second, we will have hands-on sessions for authors (or other attendants submitting a tool extended abstract) to offer a practical overview of their tool. Finally, we will have an open panel for early career or early idea presentations in a “pecha kucha” style of presentation. These presentations will try to spark conversation about researchers' ideas, to be discussed in small panels at the end of the day. The sessions will be structured as a short tutorial, where attendants to the presentation will have the opportunity to download, use, and test the tool in their own machines, following a guided example.

## Intended Audience
---
The workshop looks to bring together practitioners and researchers at different stages of their career. The workshop contents should be of interest for people working on software testing in general. Moreover, with the hands-on format planned for the workshop we expect to capture the interest of newcomers to the field.

# Relevance
---
Testing is a crucial part of the software development process, as it can  reduce the number of bugs before deployment, and in general improve the quality of a system. From a theoretical standpoint, automated testing covers many topics of interest across the ESEC/FSE community, such as: automation, abstract interpretation, faults injection, software verification, and software development processes. Additionally, the tools required for a successful testing process need to be developed carefully, often requiring a great deal of engineering work to get them to a stable state to be used by industry.

## Format
--- 
The workshop is proposed as a 2 day workshop with an initial theory-oriented keynote, followed by regular paper presentations. Each of these presentations will undergo the normal paper review process. The second day will open with a keynote-style tutorial, together with practical sessions about presenters’ tools. The idea of this second day will offer the opportunity to attendants to gather hands-on experience about new testing languages and tools. Note that the presentations during the second day do not need to be associated with a paper presented at the workshop, but can be used for the popularization of already existing and interesting tools. Nonetheless, tools not associated with regular papers, should be accompanied with an extended abstract to evaluate the relevance of the tool.

Additionally, we would like to launch a testing challenge the evening prior to the first day of the workshop as a small competition between the testing tools developed by the workshop and conference attendants.

## Submission
---
The workshop invites submissions of either new or visionary work in any of these perspectives individually, or focusing on a cross-fertilization between several of these topics. 

An explicit goal of the workshop is to confront the different programming approaches to live adaptation, and to understand how they can learn from each other or how they need to be combined to provide a more comprehensive solution to the problem of live software adaptation. We are also interested in more tool-oriented submissions, where participants would be able to present and demo their testing solutions. Therefore, contributions to the workshop should ideally include, in addition to a detailed discussion of the proposed approach (for example by defining the models, mechanisms, or testing strategies underlying that approach), a discussion of how the proposed approach on software testing could influence or be influenced by other approaches and perspectives. Although it is not mandatory, we encourage the authors to include preliminary results of using the proposed approaches/tools.

The topics of interest of the workshop include, but are not limited to:

- Domain specific automated testing: mobile, web, micro-services, IoT, context-driven,  etc.
- Chaos engineering
- Metamorphic testing
- Automated testing of quality attributes (performance, security, usability, etc.)
- Game/Play testing
- Mutation testing
- Model-based testing
- Artificial Intelligence for Software Testing
- Testing of artificial intelligence-based systems
- Empirical studies
- Experience/Industry reports

Papers must be written in English, provided as PDF documents, and follow the ACM Conference Format (10 point font, Times New Roman font family, numeric citation style). Papers’ length can be up to 6 pages including tables, figures, and bibliography. Submission will be managed through the EasyChair Submission system.

## Review and Publication
---
Accepted papers will be published as pre-proceedings, part of ACM’s Digital Library. Submissions will undergo standard peer reviewing by at least three members of the program committee. Shepherding will be a possibility after notification.  All accepted papers will be allocated a presentation slot. All paper submissions are expected to present their topic together with a hands-on mini tutorial about the use/implementation of the tool/algorithm presented in their paper.
 
## Important dates
---
|  | Deadline |
|---|---|
|Paper submission:| August 2, 2020  |
|Paper notification:| August 31, 2020  |
|Camera-ready submission:| September 18, 2020  |
|Workshop date:| April 1-2, 2018|

## Follow-up plans
---
This will be the first edition of the LANGETI workshop, which we hope to establish itself as one of the flagship workshops for the ESEC/FSE conference. With LANGETI we will build a community for software testing researchers and practitioners. We will create a software testing portal associated with LANGETI. The idea of the portal is to use it as a hub gathering information about authors and tools that participate in the workshop. Overtime, profiles for other researchers, and new testing tools can be added to the portal.

In addition to the testing portal, we will record the pecha kucha talks, to be added to the webpage. These talks will serve as a roadmap or archive of new ideas in software testing. Finally, we will add an editorial note of the workshop summarizing the main discussions (together with a detailed discussions memoir) of the workshop.

## Publicity plans
---
The publicity strategy for the workshop will be based on an online strategy sharing the information, calls and important dates of the workshop through different local and international mailing lists. Moreover, we will focus on having a presence in social network outlets, and landing pages for the workshop’s web page linked from our institution’s website. As this will be the first edition of the workshop we expect to have 7 to 15 submissions, with an expected workshop attendance of 25+ people open to all conference participants.
